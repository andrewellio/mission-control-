# Web Application

Mission Control Interface made using React.

To run the web application as localhost in a browser, first navigate to the directory `cd web_application`

## Install

This will install the libraries for a local machine.

```bash
$ npm install
```
(A node modules folder should be created)

## Run

We can run the application on a local server (i.e. localhost).

```bash
$ npm start
```
(The system's default browser should automatically open)

## Test

Once test are written, they can be run with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

## CI

Uninstalls the node modules, and reinstalls them on a clean build.

```bash
$ npm CI
```
