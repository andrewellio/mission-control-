# Health and Safety

## Risk Matrix 
| **Risk** | **Type** | **Cause** | **Effect** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Importance** | **Mitgation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---| ---| 
| High wind speeds | Environmental | Under the circumstance of moderate to severe weather conditions. These can inlcude high wind speeds | Rocket launch will be unsafe and could cause damage of property and/or persons | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | Following the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, a launch will not take place during these conditions. The weather condition will be assessed through multiple sources prior to the launch. A judgement call will be made by the team based on the data available at the time \[1\]|
| Low Visibility| Environmental | Cloud coverage, terrain, time of day and other phenomena can obscure visibility of the sky| After a launch we will not be able to track the trajectory of the rocket and see where it lands. This could results in unforseen damage to property and/or persons that could have been mitaged sooner | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | We follow the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines. If there is more than 50% cloud coverage or other objects obscuring view, less than 8km horozontal visibility, or it is night time. The launch will not take place \[1\] |
| Combustion | Hardware | Combustion producing too much heat | Rocket can potentially catch on fire even before launch. This will cause damage to the hardware and potentially cause damage of property and/or persons| Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, the person launching the rocket needsto ensure that the launcher incorporates a blast defector device to prevent impinging on flammable materials. Also the rocket must include a previoulsy tested ignition scheme which has demonstrated capability of igniting all rocket motors intended for launch. \[1\]| 
| Explosion | Hardware | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Rocket Falling over | Hardware | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi| ---| 
| Rocket Not Flying Straight | Hardware | --- | --- | Likely | Severe | High| ---| 
| Unsuccessful Launch | Technical | --- | --- | Likely | Severe | High| ---| 
| Collision with Property and/or Persons| Medical | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Eye Damage | Medical | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Moderate to Severe Burns | Medical | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Interference with Aerodrome and/or Planes | Technical | --- | --- | Possible | Moderate | Medium | ---|
