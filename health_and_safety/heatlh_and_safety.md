# Health and Safety

## Risk Matrix 
| **Risk** | **Type** | **Cause** | **Effect** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Importance** | **Mitgation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---| ---| 
| High wind speeds | Environmental | Under the circumstance of moderate to severe weather conditions. These can inlcude high wind speeds | Rocket launch will be unsafe and could cause damage of property and/or persons | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | Following the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, a launch will not take place during these conditions. The weather condition will be assessed through multiple sources prior to the launch. A judgement call will be made by the team based on the data available at the time \[1\]|
| Low Visibility| Environmental | Cloud coverage, terrain, time of day and other phenomena can obscure visibility of the sky| After a launch we will not be able to track the trajectory of the rocket and see where it lands. This could results in unforseen damage to property and/or persons that could have been mitaged sooner | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | We follow the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines. If there is more than 50% cloud coverage or other objects obscuring view, less than 8km horozontal visibility, or it is night time. The launch will not take place \[1\] |
| Combustion | Hardware | Combustion producing too much heat | Rocket can potentially catch on fire even before launch. This will cause damage to the hardware and potentially cause damage of property and/or persons| Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, the person launching the rocket needsto ensure that the launcher incorporates a blast defector device to prevent impinging on flammable materials. Also the rocket must include a previoulsy tested ignition scheme which has demonstrated capability of igniting all rocket motors intended for launch. \[1\]| 
| Explosion | Hardware | Over use of particular substances produced by rocket, causing payload to be in a explosive state. | This will increase the liklihood of the rocket to be give a explosive reaction either before launch or during flight. This can potentially cause damage of property and/or persons | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, it is a requirement that the owner of the rocket ensures that there are no flammable or explosve payload inside the rocket, meaning that the rocket should not have anthing in the payload which would cause the rocket to be in a explosive state. \[1\]| 
| Rocket Falling over | Hardware | In a situation where the rocket runs out of fuel during flight for whatever reason. Failure of parachute ejecting out of rocket.| The rocket will will no longer travel in an upward direction. Instead the rocket will be travelling in a downward direction with all the forces acting towards gravity, cauing the rocket to fall in rapid speed. | Possible | Severe | Med Hi| According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, once the rocket runs out of fuel, a recovery system must be used such as a streamer or parachute so that the rocket can return safely and undamaged, and it can be flown again. Also the recovery wadding in the rocket must be fireproof \[1\]| 
| Rocket Not Flying Straight | Hardware | --- | --- | Likely | Severe | High| ---| 
| Unsuccessful Launch | Technical | --- | --- | Likely | Severe | High| ---| 
| Collision with Property and/or Persons| Medical | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Eye Damage | Medical | Motorâ€™s exhaust from hitting the ground, or explosion occurs when rocket launching. | People get injury, their eye will get bind or vision loss. | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | Following the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, to prevent accidental eye injury,we will place launchers so that the end of the launch rod is above eye level or will cap the end of the rod when it is not in use. When launch the rocket everyone should ware goggles.| 
| Moderate to Severe Burns | Medical | --- | --- | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | ---| 
| Interference with Aerodrome and/or Planes | Technical | --- | --- | Possible | Moderate | Medium | ---|
