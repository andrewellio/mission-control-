## Risk Matrix 
| **Risk** | **Type** | **Cause** | **Effect** | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Importance** | **Mitgation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---| ---| 
| High wind speeds | Environmental | Under the circumstance of moderate to severe weather conditions. These can inlcude high wind speeds | Rocket launch will be unsafe and could cause damage of property and/or persons | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | Following the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, a launch will not take place during these conditions. The weather condition will be assessed through multiple sources prior to the launch. A judgement call will be made by the team based on the data available at the time \[1\]|
| Low Visibility| Environmental | Cloud coverage, terrain, time of day and other phenomena can obscure visibility of the sky| After a launch we will not be able to track the trajectory of the rocket and see where it lands. This could results in unforseen damage to property and/or persons that could have been mitaged sooner | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | We follow the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines. If there is more than 50% cloud coverage or other objects obscuring view, less than 8km horozontal visibility, or it is night time. The launch will not take place \[1\] |
| Combustion | Hardware | Combustion producing too much heat | Rocket can potentially catch on fire even before launch. This will cause damage to the hardware and potentially cause damage of property and/or persons| Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, the person launching the rocket need to ensure that the launcher incorporates a blast defector device to prevent impinging on flammable materials. Also the rocket must include a previoulsy tested ignition scheme which has demonstrated capability of igniting all rocket motors intended for launch. \[1\]| 
| Explosion | Hardware | Over use of particular substances produced by rocket, causing payload to be in a explosive state. | This will increase the liklihood of the rocket to be give a explosive reaction either before launch or during flight. This can potentially cause damage of property and/or persons | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, it is a requirement that the owner of the rocket ensures that there are no flammable or explosve payload inside the rocket, meaning that the rocket should not have anthing in the payload which would cause the rocket to be in a explosive state. \[1\]| 
| Rocket Falling over | Hardware | In a situation where the rocket runs out of fuel during flight for whatever reason. Failure of parachute ejecting out of rocket.| The rocket will will no longer travel in an upward direction. Instead the rocket will be travelling in a downward direction with all the forces acting towards gravity, cauing the rocket to fall in rapid speed. | Possible | Severe | Med Hi| According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, once the rocket runs out of fuel, a recovery system must be used such as a streamer or parachute so that the rocket can return safely and undamaged, and it can be flown again. Also the recovery wadding in the rocket must be fireproof \[1\]| 
| Rocket Not Flying Straight | Hardware | The reason for the rocket not flying in a uniform direction would be becuase the rocket is unstable | The forces acting on the rocket will cause the rocket to go in a falling state before the parachute is ejected out of the rocket. This allows the rocket to fall in a dangerous amount of speed which can cause damage to property and/or person(s) | Likely | Severe | High| According to the the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, everyone must have a safe distance of at least 5 meters away from the specific rocket we will likely to launch. The stability of the rocket must be checked before flight and a warning must be made to spectators to clear them away to safe distance \[1\]| 
| Unsuccessful Launch | Technical | A loss in connection between the mission control system and the rocket. False/incorrect data being displayed to the user | This creates false certainty that the rocket will launch successfully because the reality is that the data presented to the user could be incorrect and in result, could cause dangerous circumstances to the rocket/environment/person(s)| Likely | Severe | High| The data represented in the mission control system must be correct. To ensure this, there has to be a high amount of testing done to allow that there are no bugs in the system which would cause the rocket to have a unsuccessful launch.| 
| Collision with Property and/or Persons| Medical | There could be some hardware problem in the rocket (e.g. the rocket isn't stable, the recovery system isn't tested properly etc.) | If this happens, it is certain that the rocket will collide the property/person(s) with great force meaning that could cause a dangerous amount of damage or cause serious injury to person(s) affected. | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and the Model Rocketry guidelines, everyone must have a safe distance of at least 5 meters away from launch. A warning must also be made to any potential spectators to be at safe distance. The rocket should also not be launched at targets, this means into clouds, or in direction of aeroplanes. There must be a recovery system to prevent the rocket to fall when run out of fuel. \[1\]| 
| Eye Damage | Medical | Motorâ€™s exhaust from hitting the ground, or explosion occurs when rocket launching. | People get injury, their eye will get bind or vision loss. | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | Following the CAA and Model Rocketry guidelines, to prevent accidental eye injury,we will place launchers so that the end of the launch rod is above eye level or will cap the end of the rod when it is not in use. When launch the rocket everyone should ware goggles.| 
| Moderate to Severe Burns | Medical | In an event of a explosion or fire caused by the hardware of the rocket | The hardware of the rocket may have unknown issues which could cause the rocket to be in a explosive state or in a state where a lot of heat is produced. If the rocket is in flight, the liklihood of burns occuring to person(s) is low, but it's possible that rocket produces a negative reaction even before flight where people will be most vulnerable | Possible | Severe | Med Hi | According to the CAA and Model Rocketry guideline, everyone must have a safe distance of at least 5 meters away from launch. A warning must also be made to spectators to make sure that they are within safe distances of the rocket. The person launching the rocket must also ensure that the ground for a radius of 3m around the launcher is clear of brown grass, dry weeds or other easy to burn materials that could be ignited during launch by the exhaust of the rocket. \[1\]| 
| Interference with Aerodrome and/or Planes | Technical | The data displayed to the user from the mission control system displaying incorrect data | If the data displayed to the user fails to tell the user about possible interference of a aerodome/aeroplane, then there's a chance that the rocket might collide with these objects and cause unfortunate events as well as damage to hardware of the rocket | Possible | Moderate | Medium | According to the CAA and the Model Rocketry guidelines, the rocket must not be launched into clouds or near aeroplanes \[1\]. It will also be beneficial to add a function to the mission control system which would detect things like aeroplanes and aerodomes so that it can tell the user that launch isn't imminent.| 



# Safety Plans
| **Risk** | **Safety Plan** |
| ------ | ------ |
| High Wind Speeds | The weather condition will be assessed through multiple sources prior to the launch. A judegment call will be made by the team based on the data available at the time. Launch will not take place during these conditions |
| Low Visibility | If there is more than 50% cloud coverage or other objects obscuring view, less than 8km horizontal visibility, or it is night time. The launch will not take place. |
| Combustion | The rocket will only launch if the launcher incorporates a blast defector device to prevent impinging on flammable materials. As a team, we will also check that the rocket includes a previously tested ignition scheme which has demonstrated capabiity of igniting all rocket motors intended for launch |
| Explosion | The rocket will only launch if it has no flammable or explosive payload inside. This will prevent the rocket to enter into an explosive state. |
| Rocket Falling Over | The rocket will only be launched if there is a recovery system such as a streamer or parachute to ensure that the rocket can return safely and undamaged once launched. Also it will be checked if the wadding in the rocket is fireproof, if not then the rocket will not be launched |
| Rocket Not Flying Straight | Before launch, we will organise a plan to specify the positions of everyone involved in the launch. The stability of the rocket will also be checked before launch, and a warning will be made to possible spectators to spectating at a safe distance. |
| Unsuccessful Launch | Before launch, there will be a high amount of testing done to ensure that launch is successful. This mean making sure there are no issues with the system which would cause the launch to fail. |
| Collision with Property and/or Persons | A plan will be organised so that people involved in the launch are standing at a safe distance from the launcher. A warning will be made to any possible spectators so that they are spectating at a safe distance. The rocket will only be launched if there aren't any obstacles/targets in the way of launch, and that there is a recovery system within the rocket to prevent it to fall when fuel is run out. |
| Eye Damage | Launchers will be placed so that the end of the launch rod is above eye level. Also people near the launch will be required to wear safety goggles. |
| Moderate to Severe Burns | A plan will be set in place so that the people involved in the launch are at a safe distance. A warning will also be made to spectators so that they are spectating at a safe distance. Launch will not take place unless a raduis of at least 3m from the launcher is clear of brown grass, dry weeds or other easy to burn materials that are likely to be ignited by the exhaust of the rocket |
| Interference with Aerodome and/or Planes | We will not launch the rocket into clouds and check for near aeroplanes to ensure that the rocket is launchable. The mission control system will also include a function which will detect things like areoplanes or areodomes so that we ensure with more certainty whether launch can take place or not. |
